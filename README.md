# Framer-Workshop
A quick codelab I put together for the Framer Workshop organized by IxDA Gurgaon

A [sketch file](https://github.com/raveeshbhalla/Framer-Workshop/blob/master/Design.sketch?raw=true) can be downloaded which contains the raw artboards used in the prototype.

### [Step 1](https://github.com/raveeshbhalla/Framer-Workshop/tree/Step-1)
